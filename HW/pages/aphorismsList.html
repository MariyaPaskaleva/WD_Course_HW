        <p class="dark">One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was: got slow to go fast. We live as though there aren't enough hours in the day but if we do each thing calmly and carefully we will get it done quicker and with much less stress.</p>
        <p class="light">If you notice, the people who are always are those who love too much, care too much and are gentle and are kind and compassionate too much.</p>
        <p class="dark">You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing everything with logic. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breath and allow things to pass.</p>
        <p class="light">When you're going through hard times and wonder where God is, remember the teacher is always quiet during a test.</p>
        <p class="dark">If you know how quickly people forget the dead...you will stop living to impress people.</p>
        <p class="light">The greatest prison people live in is the fear of what other people think.</p>
        <p class="dark">Why do we close our eyes when we pray, cry, kiss or dream? Because the most beautiful things in life are not seen but felt by the heart.</p>
        <p class="light">The problem with closed minded people is that their mouths are always open.</p>
        <p class="dark">Some people will never like you because your spirit irritates their demons.</p>
        <p class="light">Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people.</p>
        <p class="dark">In life it's important to know when to stop arguing with people, and symply let them be wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="light">The man who asks a question is a fool for a minute. The man who does not ask a question is a fool for life.</p>
